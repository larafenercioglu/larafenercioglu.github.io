				<h2>Why I love to watch Friends</h2>
				<p class = "posted">Posted October 15, 2018</p>
				<p>I've started watching Friends when i was 17 or sth. In the first season I found very stupid however as time passed by i've become obbessed and never stoped watching. I started to relate myself to some characters. At first I loved Monica but then her characteristic made me uncomfortable. But I still love her obv since I love everything about Friends. Well.. there are things that I don't like such as *****spoiler***** Joey and Rachel!!!!!</p>
